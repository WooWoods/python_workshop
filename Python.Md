# PYTHON RESOURCES

### Ways to learn Python:

* This [book](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/) is free and is how I learned Python. It covers all the basics in an order that makes sense.
* This is a free [online course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python) - offered by UMich - that teaches you how to code in Python. 
* Here is another free [online course](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-mitx-6-00-1x-6), this one offered through MIT.
* [CodeAcademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python) is one of my favorite resources, because they allow you to practice coding in the web browser, and they have created very nice discrete tasks to guide your learning. Some of the content is behind a paywall.
* This is a good and free [textbook](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/thinkCSpy/thinkCSpy.pdf) that emphasizes how to think about Python from a computer science perspective. 
* Another free [textbook](http://www.diveintopython.net/#download)
* A [website](https://www.dataquest.io/learn) that teaches you how to code Python with a focus on data analysis - however, only parts of the content are free 
* This used to be my favorite [online course](https://www.udacity.com/programming-languages/python) for Python, but now it costs money :( It is free for 14 days if you want to check it out
* I love this [website](http://learnpythonbreakpython.com/) because it teaches you Python by teaching you all the ways you can break Python, so it gets into the specifics of Python syntax that might give you problems
* Google has a [Python course](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/), too
* [CheckIO](www.checkio.org) has you complete tasks as you learn code - it is designed to be a game. I found it a bit clunky to use, but I think the idea is really neat, and you might have better mileage.
* [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) hosts small challenges that can be solved in a number of programming languages, including Python. It is a fun way to learn how to code, which is especially helpful because you can read other people's solutions both in Python and in other languages you might know.
* This [website](http://www.practicepython.org/) has a more diverse set of challenges to try to improve at Python.


### Useful resources

* A [flowchart](https://www.dropbox.com/s/cqsxfws52gulkyx/drawing.pdf) to help you figure out where the error in your code is.
* [Common mistakes](http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/python/2004/02/05/learn_python.html) in Python
* [Comparison](http://hyperpolyglot.org/) of different programming languages
* [Glossary](https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonGlossary) of Python words
* [PEP-0008](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guide for Python
* A [list](https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/) of built-in Python libraries
* The [official Python tutorial](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/) - it's a bit dry
* Python [code cookbook](http://code.activestate.com/recipes/langs/python/views/)
* [Guidelines](http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001745) for good computer practices


# USEFUL LIBRARIES FOR DATA ANALYSIS
### Basic Functionality
- **re**: built-in library to search text via regular expressions
- **random**: built-in library that is useful whenever you want some randomness in your code
- **math**: a lot of basic math functionality is in this module, such as logarithmics
- **decimal**: built-in library that is useful for handling problems with floating-point precision in 
- **datetime**: built-in library that helps deal with date and time data
- **subprocess**: built-in library that allows you to call external programs from within Python

### Data analysis and graphing
- **numpy**: external library, particularly useful for when you want to work with arrays
- **Pandas**: my favorite library, provides excellent support for data organization and summary when the data is presented in tables
- **matplotlib**: the main library to make plots in Python
- **seaborn**: a useful external library that makes Python's default plots much more attractive

### Databases and the Internet
- **urllib2**: internal library, good way to open up websites via Python
- **BeautifulSoup**: external library, easiest way I know to scrape data from websites
- **requests**: a library that allows you to request data from APIs
- **Django / Flask**: provides functionality that allows you to build websites with Python 
- **sqlite**: provides functionality to use Python to interact with SQL databases
- **json**: helps parse JSON data structures; JSON is a popular way to store data



### Scientific computing
- **scikit-learn**: external library, good for machine learning
- **scipy**: external library, good for model fitting, image processing, statistics
- **networkx**: external library that is useful for analyzing networks and graphs
- **Statsmodels**: external library that provides many tools for statistics (i.e., ANOVAs, linear regressions)and model fit
- **NLTK**: external library for Natural Language Processing
- **geopy**: external library, good for working with map data
