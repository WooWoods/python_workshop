1. Introductions
	- Who we are
	- Why programming?
	- It doesn't matter if you know any programming already
	- But once you know one language, much easier to switch to another
2. Getting set up 
	- https://try.jupyter.org/
	- Recommend downloading the (free!) Anaconda distribution for Python - includes Python, this notebook format, and most basic libraries useful for math & science
3. Red and green stickies
4. Variables
	- just basic idea of variables
	- [Lesson](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/02-variables/)
	- What are things you might want to store in variables?
5. Loops
	- first introduce lists, a variable that contains other variables
	- [Lesson](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/12-for-loops/)
	- Note: won't do all exercises as unnecessary; not relevant without data
	- How might you use loops?
6. Conditionals
	- [Lesson](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/17-conditionals/)
	- Note: won't do all exercises as unnecessary; not relevant without data
7. Functions
	- [Lesson](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/06-func/)
	- Note: won't do all exercises as unnecessary; not relevant without data
